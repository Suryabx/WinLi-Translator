# Winli-Translator

## Description
**Winli-Translator** is a cross-platform application designed to **translate Windows applications** into a format that can be executed on Linux systems. It converts Windows-specific system calls into Linux-compatible onesâ€”**no emulation or virtualization needed**â€”so you can run Windows apps natively on Linux.

## Usage

### Start the application
```bash
npm start
```
Or launch it from your system launcher.

### Load .exe File
Use the interface to select a Windows application `.exe` file you want to run on Linux.

### Translation
Winli-Translator processes the file, mapping Windows API calls to Linux system calls.

### Execution
The translated application runs natively on your Linux machine.
